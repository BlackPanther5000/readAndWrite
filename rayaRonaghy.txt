Raya Ronaghy Line 1: One of the projects I created is the 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' project. Line 2: I am proud of the way I made this project, but I think it could improve visually. Line 3: It would be nice if the game had visuals to go along with it. Line 4: Maybe an image of a rock, or paper, or scissors could show when the player selects one. Line 5: But I still think the game is great without it.
